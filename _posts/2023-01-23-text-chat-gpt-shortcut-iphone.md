ChatGPT would be a great personal assistant if you could access it on the go and if it had infinite [attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). 

Conveniently enough, Apple shortcuts allow you to open callback URLs and do all sorts of fun scripting which let me create this apple shortcut to directly ask ChatGPT questions from my phone.

As of fall 2021, shortcuts are [available and synced to your Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts-mac/intro-to-shortcuts-apdf22b0444c/mac) as well as your Apple watch (if you have one).

ChatGPT is also a fairly interesting conversation topic as almost everyone has heard about it but not everyone has had the chance to try it. It's nice to have a demo on hand because it comes up so frequently--and isn't it so interesting? 

Here's the [iCloud Link](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d8fa0573067b49b190803f1d6f4e6f06) to the shortcut.
